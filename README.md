# SoftEther Autoinstaller

This is my SoftEther autoinstaller. This will compile and install SoftEther onto your server. This installer in particular will set up SoftEther as a system service.

## Getting Started

First, if you like to stay on the edge of things, feel free to use the beta branch: `git clone -b beta https://github.com/icoexist/softether-autoinstall.git`

### Prerequisites

It's always nice to have an up-to-date system, however the autoinstaller will attempt to do this for you. Please make sure you run this script with sudo if you are not root.

### We're not done here!

This readme will be updated as soon as I have the time to get further into GitHub. For now, I've literally just started and I'm still messing with things. Please don't hurt me.
