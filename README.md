# SoftEther Autoinstaller

This is my SoftEther autoinstaller. This will compile and install SoftEther onto your server. This installer in particular will set up SoftEther as a system service. Currently Ubuntu and CentOS are supported.

## Getting Started

Find the install script for your distro. Currently Ubuntu and CentOS are supported. Please make sure you get the correct "bit" as well. You can't compile a 64-bit application on a 32-bit machine.

Once you've located the correct script, you can just copy/paste it into your favorite text editer or clone it so it can be executed on the server. Don't forget to mark it as executable!

### Prerequisites

It's always nice to have an up-to-date system, however the autoinstaller will attempt to do this for you. ~~Please make sure you run this script with sudo if you are not root.~~ The scripts will automatically require you to authenticate with sudo.

### We're not done here!

This readme will be updated as soon as I have the time to get further into GitHub. For now, I've literally just started and I'm still messing with things. Please don't hurt me.
